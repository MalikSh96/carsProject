# Announcement/disclaimer
Support folder is only containing extra frameworks and libraries that I am using for my project.
I have not developed any of the content in the Support folder, only made use of it for the purpose of learning and developing.
I take no credit for them :) \
I installed through npm (node package manager) help for using datatables, those I have not used as of now, and so far
I am not sure if I will use it later, for now it is installed.
# carsProject
THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES.

# Where are we so far
Well so far we are at a point, where there is a lot of backend functionality that is waiting for be used.
Made a few different paths that a user can redirect to, also now it is possible to:\
  -Register a user.\
  -Sign in with an existent user.\
  -On index.php you see a table with cars.\
  -Also a nav bar which is the one that redirects.\
  -Made some visual design, so the page looks prettier.\
  -Fixed pathings so they redirect correctly.\
  -Once you click on a car from the table, it takes you to another page based on the id of the car you clicked.\
  -Made it possible to register a car, for now anyone can register a car -> this will get changed later to only admin rights feature.\
  -Made it possible to remove a car based on its serialnumber, so if the serialnumber exists in the database it gets removed.

# What do we need and where do we want to go
WILL BE UPDATED AT SOME POINT LATER ON
