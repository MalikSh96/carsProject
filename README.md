# Before
Support folder is only containing extra frameworks and libraries that I am using for my project.
I have not developed any of the content in the Support folder, only made use of it for the purpose of learning and developing.
I take no credit for them :)
# carsProject
THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES.

# Where are we so far
Well so far we are at a point, where there is a lot of backend functionality that is waiting for be used.
Made a few different paths that a user can redirect to, also now it is possible to:
  \-Register a user.
  \-Sign in with an existent user.
  \-On index.php you see a table with cars
  \-Also a nav bar which is the one that redirects
  
# What do we need and where do we want to go
WILL BE UPDATED AT SOME POINT LATER ON
